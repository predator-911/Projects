Introduction
Welcome to my House Price prediction machine learning model repository! In this project, I’ve built a model to predict house prices based on various features.
The dataset used is from Kaggle’s “House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques” competition.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. Our goal is to predict the sale price of houses.
Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values by imputing or dropping rows/columns.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaled numerical features (standardization or normalization).
Feature Engineering
Created new features (e.g., total square footage, age of the house).
Removed irrelevant features.
Model Selection and Training
Explored various algorithms (linear regression, random forests, etc.).
Split data into training and validation sets.
Evaluated models using mean squared error and R-squared.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can predict house prices. Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
