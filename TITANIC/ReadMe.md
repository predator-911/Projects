Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
Welcome to my Titanic Survival Prediction project! In this Kaggle competition, we delve into the tragic story of the RMS Titanic, aiming to predict passenger survival based on various features. Let’s dive in:

Overview 🌊
The RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that tragically sank on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States.
Of the approximately 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, a devastating 1,496 lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history.
Key Insights & Findings 🕵️‍♀️
Passenger Demographics: We explored features like age, gender, and ticket class to understand their impact on survival.
Women and Children First: The famous “women and children first” policy played a significant role. Women and children had higher survival rates.
First-Class Advantage: First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to those in lower classes.
Lifeboats: The availability of lifeboats was crucial. Only 20 lifeboats were onboard, sufficient for 1,178 people.
Data Exploration & Modeling 📊
Data Loading: We loaded the provided datasets (train.csv and test.csv).
Feature Engineering: We created new features and handled missing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between features.
Model Selection: Explored various algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict survival.
