Store Sales Time Series Forecasting Model
Introduction
Welcome to my Store Sales Time Series Forecasting model repository! In this project, I’ve built a model to predict store sales using time series data. 
The dataset used is from Kaggle’s “Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting” competition1.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains historical sales data for various stores.
Each record includes information such as date, store ID, and sales amount.
Our goal is to forecast future sales based on past patterns.
Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and transformed the time series data.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Created features like lag variables and rolling averages.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored sales trends over time.
Visualized seasonality and trends using line plots and decomposition.
Feature Engineering
Extracted relevant features (e.g., day of the week, month, holidays).
Created lag features to capture autocorrelation.
Model Selection and Training
Explored time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet).
Split data into training and validation sets.
Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
Model Performance
Our best model achieved an RMSE of X on the validation set.
Investigated residuals and model diagnostics.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how time series forecasting can help predict store sales. Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
