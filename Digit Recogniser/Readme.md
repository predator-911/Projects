Digit Recognizer ML Model
Introduction
Welcome to my Digit Recognizer machine learning model repository!
In this project, Iâ€™ve built a model to recognize handwritten digits using the famous MNIST dataset1. The goal is to predict the correct digit (0-9) based on pixel values.
Dataset Description
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Each image represents a digit from 0 to 9.
The dataset is widely used for training and evaluating digit recognition models.
Data Preprocessing
Normalized pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
Flattened the 28x28 images into a vector of length 784.
Model Selection and Training
Explored various algorithms (e.g., neural networks, random forests).
Split data into training and validation sets.
Evaluated models using accuracy and confusion matrices.
Model Performance
Our best model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the validation set.
Visualized misclassified digits to identify areas for improvement.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can recognize handwritten digits. Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
