My Data Science Portfolio 📊
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I showcase my data science projects and explorations. Below, you’ll find summaries of some of the exciting challenges I’ve tackled:
1. Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
Description: In the famous Kaggle Titanic competition, I predicted passenger survival based on features like age, gender, and ticket class.
Key Insights: Women and children had higher survival rates, and first-class passengers were more likely to survive.

2. Spaceship Titanic Mystery 🌌
Description: In this cosmic challenge, I explored alternate dimension transportation using machine learning. Passengers’ fate depended on factors like “CryoSleep.”
Key Findings: Cryosleep was a significant predictor of alternate dimension transport.
